<small>I am a <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> student at <b>Lehigh University</b>. My interests span among the field of <b>HVAC, Cooling, and Control Systems</b>.<br></small>

I am currently building a prototype spraying station to study the effectiveness of <b>spray cooling</b>, how it varies from different dielectric fluids, multi-phases, and spray angles.
